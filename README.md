# Guide Website
## Information
This guide website was created for a university leacure teaching the basics of web developement. 

The task was to create an online platform for learning any topic. The user had to have the possibility to interact with the content on the site though. I decided to build a guide-website where the users can upload their own guides and share them with other users. 

## Prerequisites
This project was built using PHP 8. 

The SQLite Drivers have to be enabled to run the code on a local webserver.
